## Get started

Well the steps to configure this is very simple. I'm using the pnpm version `7.16.7` and `v19.0.1` of node.js, once clarified, let's explain the commands found in the `package.json`. 



```json
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "start": "next build && next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "prepare": "husky install",
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged --allow-empty"
  },
```

- dev: run our project locally
- start: create the build in production and run the app in a production environment
- lint: check that we comply with the rules defined in our eslint configuration file
- pre-commit: it defines the hook to execute before committing to a file

## Why i choose Next

Next.js is one of the most popular frameworks in the React ecosystem, it allows us great flexibility when building our applications, we can take approaches such as SSR, CSR or make a mix between both, which produces ISR. 

 I'm using this project as an experiment to see how a modern app would work in Next.js 13 and server components.

## Why i chose vercel

This part of the story is where â–²Vercel comes in. It combines the best developer experience with an obsessive focus on end-user performance. The platform enables frontend teams to do their best work, its application deployment infrastructure is based on serverless functions
